Watch out for ioshell not working
        It's supposed to be runnign as root, getting permission to run io
        ports, change user to you, run program
        
        Man pages suggest permissions should persist across an exec

Lab 4:
        Using ATMEGA
        Using Port B
        Reading from switches, controlling LEDS. No external pull-ups.
        Port B, Pin B

        Port ... 8 bit register
        Any output pins take out the value you write to the port
        If you read from the port register, you'll read last value
        written to the port register. 

        Writing to port affects outputs,
        Reading from port only sees what was last written
        Reading from pin register shows actual voltages on pins (currently)

        Direction: 1 is output, 0 is input
        DDRB = 8 bits, corresponding to 8 pins of Port B
